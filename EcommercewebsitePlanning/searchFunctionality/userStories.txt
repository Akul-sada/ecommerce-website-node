Here are some features that you may want to consider implementing in order to provide search functionality on your e-commerce website:

    Basic search: This would allow users to enter a keyword or phrase and see a list of products that match the search term.

    Advanced search: This would allow users to filter their search results by various criteria such as price range, brand, color, etc.

    Autocomplete: This would suggest search terms as the user types, based on the most popular or relevant searches.

    Search refinements: This would allow users to narrow their search results by selecting specific filters or facets, such as category or brand.

    Spell check: This would correct common spelling errors and suggest alternative search terms.

    Synonym support: This would allow users to find products even if they use different terms or phrases to describe them.

    Personalization: This would allow the search results to be tailored to the user's past search and purchase history.

    Search analytics: This would allow you to track and analyze search trends and usage patterns, which can be helpful for identifying areas for improvement and for making informed business decisions.

It's important to keep in mind that the specific features you choose to implement will depend on your target audience, the type of products you sell, and the overall goals of your e-commerce website.
